# Ultramarathon Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
Ultramarathon races test the limits of human endurance.  
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of ultramarathon race data to understand participation patterns, performance trends, and demographic characteristics of runners.


---

## Objectives
- Explore participant demographics and race characteristics
- Analyze performance trends across distance and time
- Identify patterns and outliers in endurance race data

---

## Dataset
- Public ultramarathon race dataset
- Includes information on race distance, finish times, participants, and other attributes

> Raw data files are not included in this repository.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn

---

## Project Structure
---
## Key Findings
- Participation varies significantly by race distance
- Finish times show wide variability, reflecting endurance demands
- Outliers highlight exceptional performance and extreme race conditions

---

## Scope & Limitations
- This analysis is descriptive and exploratory
- No machine learning or predictive modeling is performed
- Insights depend on the quality and completeness of the source data
